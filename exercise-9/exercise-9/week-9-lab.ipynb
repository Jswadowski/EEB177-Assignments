    "**a. Describe the changes in Speciation rates across the Canidae lineage.**  \n",
    "    Speciation rates seem to be relatively unchanged from 50Ma to about 20Ma. it then dips to about 0.1 speciation rate and remains relatively constant until it rises sharply to about 0.25 speciation rate at 5 Ma. \n",
    "**b. Describe the changes in Extinction rates across the Canidae lineage.**  \n",
    "    Extinction rates seem to be relatively constant from about 50Ma to about 3Ma, demonstrating a slight increase. However, there is a very sudden and steep rise in extinction rate at that point, increasing from about 0.1 to 1.2 extinction rate. \n",
    "**c. Describe the changes in Diversification rates across the Canidae lineage.**  \n",
    "    Net diversification rate was positive until 20Ma where it became negative. At about 8Ma, it increased and became positive again only to see a very sudden and steep decline at about 2Ma from about 0.1 to -0.8 net diversification rate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Question: Do you see anything different about these RTT plots compared to the ones you had made with only 250000 steps in the MCMC chain?**  \n",
    "    Overall, the RTT plots of 2.5 million simulations as compared to 250,000 show similar trends in speciation, extinction and diversification rates across the Canidae lineage. A difference is that the relatively constant regions displayed by the 250,000 simulated-generated plots now more changed but the trend remains the same. "
